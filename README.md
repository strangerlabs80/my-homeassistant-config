# Home Assistant YAML Configurations

Welcome to my repository of **Home Assistant** configurations. This project serves as a collection of YAML snippets, dashboard designs, and automation logic used to power and monitor my smart home setup.

## 🔍 Repository Organization

This repository is organized to help you easily find and implement specific configurations into your own setup. Each file is named indicatively based on its specific function:

* **`dashboards/`**: This directory contains YAML files for various UI components, including ApexCharts and Mini-Graph-Card configurations. While currently focused on my active setup, this section will grow with new types of cards and visualizations over time.
* **`automations/`**: Here you will find the logic that makes the home "smart," including tablet management (Fully Kiosk Browser), power safety routines, and system-level notifications.
* **`scripts/`**: Files dedicated to specific sequences of actions that can be triggered by dashboards or other automations.
* **`blueprints/`**: Ready-to-use templates for common automation patterns.
* **`assets/`**: Visual references and screenshots to show the final result of the code snippets provided.

## 🛠️ Usage

Each file follows a specific naming convention to indicate its purpose. You can copy the code and adapt the `entity_id` values to match your own sensors and devices in Home Assistant.
